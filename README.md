*By the end of the course, using MATLAB to analyze the light recoreded from a star to determine if it's movig towards or away from the Earth.*

### NOTES

When you enter a command without a semicolon at the end, MATLAB displays the result.

```m
>> x = 5 + 1
x = 
    6
```

Optionally, you can add a semicolon to the end of a command so that the result is not displayed. MATLAB still executes the command, and you can see the variable in the Workspace browser.

```m
>> x = 5 + 1;
```
